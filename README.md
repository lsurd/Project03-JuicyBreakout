## Implementation
Which features you included
- The basic in unity font was changed on both the main menu, and end game menu
- In regards to the main menu, I added checkerboard shaders to give it a background. I also changed the name of the game on the main menu to "gem gougers" because I was going with the overall aesthetic of a dragon breaking down gemstones to collect them for a horde
- In chiptone I edited/created sound effects for the brick breaking, hitting the paddle, and death noise
- In line with the change of title, I edited the appearance of the paddle, bricks, and ball to look like a red dragon in paddle form spitting a blue fireball at randomized colored gemstones
- For the gemstones/bricks I added a randomized fading in
- There was also a fading out animation when bricks were broken by the fire ball, as well as a screen shake when the ball hits the bricks
- There were also eyes added to the dragon paddle which follow the line of the fire ball
